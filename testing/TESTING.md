## Browser compatibility

### Tested browsers and devices

I tested these browser versions on these devices:

**Desktop PC (64-bit, Windows 10):**

- Google Chrome Version 91.0.4472.77 (Official Build) (64-bit)
- Firefox Version 89.0 (64-bit)
- Microsoft Edge Version 91.0.864.41 (Official build) (64-bit)
- iOS (via https://www.browserstack.com/)

**Dell E7240 laptop (64-bit, Windows 10):**

- Opera Version 77.0.4054.60 (64-bit)

**Samsung Galaxy S7 (Android Version 8.0.0):**

- Samsung internet Version 13.2.2.4
- Brave Browser Version 1.23.76

### What I tested

List of things that I tested:

- If elements display correctly in size and order
- If images display correctly
- If all the (internal) links work
- If hover effects work
- If the JavaScript functionality works
- If the Python functionality works
- In general I tested the entire website, to see if it displayed and worked as intended.

### Browser compatibility testing results

**Google Chrome Version 91.0.4472.77 (Official Build) (64-bit):**

Everything is working and displaying as intended. [(screenshot)](testing-img/chrome.png)

**Firefox Version 89.0 (64-bit):**

Everything is working and displaying as intended. [(screenshot)](testing-img/firefox.png)

**Microsoft Edge Version 91.0.864.41 (Official build) (64-bit):**

Everything is working and displaying as intended. [(screenshot)](testing-img/opera.png)

**iOS:**

I've tested a couple of iOS 12 and 13 devices on [Browserstack](https://www.browserstack.com/). When I wasn't logged in there weren't any issues as you can see using this [iPhone 11 Pro](testing-img/iphone11pro.png) with iOS 13, the entire website displayed correctly. When I logged in there was a small display issue on the albums page, as you can see on this [iPad Air 2019](testing-img/ipadair2019.png) with iOS 13. The submit button was only half visible, but it was still clickable and functioning. The same issue occured when I tested an iPhone 8 with iOS 12, but the rest of the website had no issues, things like [the mobile navigation menu](testing-img/iphone8.png) all displayed correctly. Unfortunately I wasn't allowed to test any iOS 14 devices this time, but from previous experience it's likely that iOS 14 devices are performing equal if not better than older iOS devices, so I expect no major issues there.

**Opera Version 77.0.4054.60 (64-bit):**

Smooth scroll didn't work at first, but it turned out to be a browser setting similar to Google Chrome. So everything is working and displaying as intended. [(screenshot)](testing-img/opera.png)

**Samsung internet Version 13.2.2.4:**

Everything is working and displaying as intended. [(screenshot)](testing-img/samsung.jpg)

**Brave Browser Version 1.23.76:**

Everything is working and displaying as intended. [(screenshot)](testing-img/brave.jpg)

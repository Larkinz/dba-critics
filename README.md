Milestone Project 3: Python and Data Centric Development â€“ [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/)

This website was made as my third milestone project for the Code Institute course. The website was created for fans of the band [Dead by April](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_by_April), to provide them with some general information and to rate and discuss their album discography. The project requirements were to create a full-stack website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Flask and MongoDB.

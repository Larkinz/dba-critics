Milestone Project 3: Python and Data Centric Development â€“ [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/)

This website was made as my third milestone project for the Code Institute course. The website was created for fans of the band [Dead by April](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_by_April), to provide them with some general information and to rate and discuss their album discography. The project requirements were to create a full-stack website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Flask and MongoDB.

## User experience design (UXD)

### Strategy

#### Goal

The goal for the website is to provide fans of the band Dead by April with some general information, as well as a place to rate and discuss their album discography.

#### User stories

- As a **visitor**, I would like **to see an overview of the upcoming tour**, so that **I know where and when the next concerts take place**.

- As a **visitor**, I would like **to rate albums**, so that **I can compare the ratings with other fans**.

- As a **visitor**, I would like **to discuss albums**, so that **I can share my thoughts with other fans**.

- As a **site owner**, I would like our website **to have an intuitive navigation system**, so that **visitors can easily find what they are looking for**.

- As a **site owner**, I would like **to prevent unique visitors from voting twice**, so that **album ratings can't easily be cheated**.

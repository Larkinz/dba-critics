Milestone Project 3: Python and Data Centric Development â€“ [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/)

This website was made as my third milestone project for the Code Institute course. The website was created for fans of the band [Dead by April](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_by_April), to provide them with some general information and to rate and discuss their album discography. The project requirements were to create a full-stack website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Flask and MongoDB.

## User experience design (UXD)

### Strategy

#### Goal

The goal for the website is to provide fans of the band Dead by April with some general information, as well as a place to rate and discuss their album discography.

#### User stories

- As a **visitor**, I would like **to see an overview of the upcoming tour**, so that **I know where and when the next concerts take place**.

- As a **visitor**, I would like **to rate albums**, so that **I can compare the ratings with other fans**.

- As a **visitor**, I would like **to discuss albums**, so that **I can share my thoughts with other fans**.

- As a **site owner**, I would like our website **to have an intuitive navigation system**, so that **visitors can easily find what they are looking for**.

- As a **site owner**, I would like **to prevent unique visitors from voting twice**, so that **album ratings can't easily be cheated**.

### Scope

#### Functional specifications

The website should have navigation to switch between the different sections of the homepage and to navigate to other pages, such as the album or the login page. There should be buttons that link to external websites, such as concert ticket sellers. Content on the website should support different screen sizes. Wherever appropriate and or possible, visible indicators should be shown to users when they can perform an action on the website (like clicking a link or a button).

#### Content requirements

The website should display information on current band members. The website should provide links to the official Dead by April blog. The website should display a tour schedule and provide links to purchase concert tickets. The website should display album information. The website should provide the option to rate albums. The website should provide the option to discuss or comment on albums. The website should provide links to the official Dead by April social media channels.

### Structure

#### Information architecture

The website has a landing page with a button to the actual homepage. On the homepage there are 4 different sections to navigate to: welcome, band, blog, and tour. On the homepage visitors can also navigate to an album page and a login page.

#### Interaction design

Depending on their device, users could see through visible indicators like changes of colour and/or changing mouse pointers whether something is clickable. Icons such as an arrow pointing down indicate to users that an element can be expanded. Users with touchscreens can swipe up and down to scroll through the page, and they can (double)tap to select buttons and navigation elements. No audio will be used in this website.

### Skeleton

On large screen sizes the logo will be displayed on the left in the navbar and all the navigation links are on the right. On medium to small screen sizes the logo will be displayed in the center of the navbar and on the right will be a hamburger menu icon. On both the homepage and the albums page a footer will be displayed at the bottom of the page on all screen sizes. The footer will contain social media icons with links. In the home section of the homepage there will be some paragraphs with titles displayed below each other on all screen sizes. There will be an image separating each section of the homepage on all screen sizes. In the band section of the homepage there will be an image displayed and some information next to it for each band member on large and medium screen sizes, on small screen sizes this information will be displayed below the image. In the blog section of the homepage there will be two blogs next to each other on large screen sizes, on medium and small screen sizes the blogs will be below each other. In the tour section of the homepage there will be event information containers displayed below each other on all screen sizes. On the albums page an expandable collapsible will be displayed for each album in the center of the screen on all screen sizes. The first collapsible contains the album title and the body contains an image of the album cover and some general information. The second collapsible contains a tracklist. The third collapsible contains a comment section unique to each album. At the bottom of each set of album collapsibles some kind of rating system will be displayed.

#### Wireframes

To see all the wireframes in a single PDF [click here](wireframes/dba-critics-wireframes-pdf.pdf).

To see separate PNG image files of the wireframes check the wireframes folder.

### Surface

#### Colours

The first thing that came to my mind was to use a dark type of blue for this project, I think that would go well with some kind of off-white colour. I also plan to experiment with some linear gradients, so I would also need a lighter type of blue to go with the dark blue. Some kind of colour that pops could be very useful too, my initial thought is to go with some kind of orange or yellow, but I might decide to change this later.

![Colour palette](wireframes/colour-palette.png)

#### Typography

From my experience with previous projects I like the font-style 'Montserrat' from the Google Fonts library, it looks clean and professional, and it's a very readable font-style. I don't think I will be needing more than one font-style, but if I do, I will make sure to add that here later.

#### Uniformity

To keep the website looking uniform I will do my best to make sure that all related contents throughout the website are consistent in font size and styling. The positioning of elements and contents should be consistent in height, padding and spacing. I'm also using either grid, flexbox or both to present the content in a logical order, either through custom CSS or through the Materialize framework.

## Database schema

For this project we were required to use MongoDB as a cloud database service. In total I used 3 collections: users, comments, and ratings. In the images below you can see an overview diagram and an example of each of the collections.

![Database schema](docs/database-schema.png)

The users collection holds the \_id key, which is automatically generated by MongoDB, the username, and the password that has SHA-512 encryption.

![User](docs/database-user.png)

The comments collection holds the \_id key, which is automatically generated by MongoDB, the comment content, the album id, and the username.

![Comment](docs/database-comment.png)

The ratings collection holds the \_id key, which is automatically generated by MongoDB, the rating (of 1 to 100), the album id, and the username.

5. Click **connect to github**.
6. Enter your repo name and click search.
7. Click **connect**.
8. Scroll up and click on the **settings** tab.

![Heroku settings](docs/heroku-settings.png)

9. Click **reveal config vars**.
10. Add the correct environment variables.

![environment variables](docs/environment-variables.png)

11. In your repo folder create an **env.py** file.
12. In the env.py file copy and paste the following code, and make sure to match the config vars values that you entered in Heroku earlier:

```
import os

os.environ.setdefault("IP", "0.0.0.0")
os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "5000")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "enter your database name here")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", "enter your MONGO_URI here")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", "enter your secret key here")

```

13. Add both `env.py and __pycache__/` to a .gitignore file (both on separate lines).

![git ignore](docs/git-ignore.png)

14. In your terminal enter the following command: `pip3 install Flask`
15. Commit these changes to Github.
16. Go back to the Heroku website, scroll up and click the **deploy** tab.

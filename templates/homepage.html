            <h2>Dead by April</h2>
            <p>Dead by April is a Swedish metalcore band from Gothenburg, formed in February 2007 by Pontus Hjelm and Jimmie Strimell. The current band line-up consists of Pontus Hjelm, Marcus Wesslén, Christopher Kristensen, and Marcus Rosell. Despite many line-up changes throughout their careers, both Marcus Wesslén and Pontus Hjelm have remained consistently involved with the band since their debut album. The band was formed in early 2007, when Jimmie Strimell, the lead vocalist of Nightrage, decided to collaborate with songwriter and former Cipher System member Pontus Hjelm. During the band's early days in 2007 and 2008, the band did not release any physical media, though most of the songs that they gave to friends were quickly leaked out to several peer-to-peer-sites, with the first songs being "Lost" and "Stronger". In May 2009, Dead by April released their self-titled debut album, it is the only album to feature former guitarist Johan Olsson. In August 2010, they released a teaser for a new song called "Within My Heart", which was released, along with the new album called "Incomparable", in early 2011. The album is heavier and more dynamic than their self-titled album. In March 2013, it was confirmed by the band that Jimmie Strimell was no longer part of the band and had been replaced by Christoffer Andersson. The band released a new single on 6 December 2013 titled "As a Butterfly", which would be included in their third studio album released in February 2014, called "Let the World Know". Shortly after the release of Let the World Know, drummer Alexander Svenningson announced he had left the band and had been quickly replaced by Marcus Rosell. On 7 April 2017, they released their fourth studio album called "Worlds Collide". One week later Christoffer Andersson announced he parted ways with the band, which sparked the return of vocalist Jimmie Strimell. In March 2020 a statement was released citing that Jimmie Strimell had been dismissed from the band for a second time; due to his continued drug and alcohol abuse, in spite of his own vows to stay sober. Shortly afterwards, Christopher Kristensen joined the band as replacement vocalist. In March 2021, Dead by April released their latest single and music video for "Heartbeat Failing" on both YouTube and streaming platforms.</p>
